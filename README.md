# CodeClan Final Project: UK Productivity
 
## Colin Scotland | DE13

The final CodeClan project was designed as an exercise for each individual to
work alone to carry out an end-to-end data project. This allowed the freedom to
consolidate and expand upon what had been taught during the course.

After analysis the findings had to be presented using slides and a written
markdown report with appropriate documentation of data source, quality and ethics.

The project was written entirely in R using RStudio, with plots generated in
ggplot.

The data for this project was donated by Deloitte and comes from the Equifax 
Ignite Direct open source data platform.

All planning, coding, analysis and reporting are contained within the folder
structure on github.
