# Context

#### Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

The aim of the project was to answer the following questions;

* How can we improve productivity within Scotland and the UK overall? 

Some targeted questions of interest in this specific project;

* What factors can be improved to increase employee and/or business productivity 
across UK regions? 
* Which industries are lagging behind in terms of productivity and how could 
they catch up? 
* Can we predict overall UK productivity rates?

#### Domain knowledge and the business context

The data used in this analysis come from Deloitte, who in the company's own words 
are a leading global provider of audit and assurance, consulting, financial 
advisory, risk advisory, tax, and related services. 

As part of their services to a myriad industries, Deloitte analyse the larger
economic situation at a national and global scale in order to identify potential
opportunities, trends, and challenges to support global businesses.

Different companies employ different strategies depending on their own requirements,
but it is important for Deloitte in providing financial services to these companies
to know how economies around the world are performing in order to be able to 
provide regional-level insights on a global scale.

# Data

#### Internal and external data sources

The data ued in this analysis was donated by Deloitte and comes from the Equifax 
Ignite Direct data platform.  Most of the individual data sets originated in the 
UK's Office for National Statistics and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), and reflects measures and estimates put in 
place in accordance with OECD guidelines.

* https://www.oecd.org/


#### Types of data

The data consisted of many different types, as outlined below;

* Categorical; Country Names, Industry Types, UK Regions, Age Group groups, 
UK Commuting Time groups, etc.
* Numerical; Years, Productivity Output Values, Employment Levels, Education
Indices, etc.
* Time Series; Year, Quarter, with some data converted into tsibbles for time
series analyses.

For the purposes of analysis several data types were transformed, e.g. from 
categorical to factor, or tibbles to tsibbles  to allow statistical analyses 
to be carried out.

#### Data formats

The data was almost entirely taken from Microsoft Excel workbooks (-.xls and 
-.xlsx), most of which consisted of multiple worksheets with many merged cells 
which needed to be manipulated in R to allow for further processing.  
Fortunately many of the Excel worksheets were formatted identically, so a lot of 
repeated data cleaning was optimised by writing functions. 

#### Data quality and bias

The data sourced mainly from OECD countries limits the overall global 
representation.  No African or Asian countries are considered (except for Japan). 

What the OECD data does allow is comparisons between countries of similar economic 
status within Europe, N. America, Australasia, Chile and Japan.

Within the UK-centric data there are no categories that suggest any obvious bias
towards any demographic, with productivity measures broken down by the ONS NUTS1 
regional definition and industry types as defined in ONS' Standard Industrial 
Classification (2007).

Apart from the presence of merged cells in the worksheets, the data was already
very clean with no missing values or ambiguities.

# Ethics

#### Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

The only ethical point of note is the absence of African and Asian countries as
mentioned previously.  In the context of investigating the economic performance
of the UK this is not critical; Europe and N. America provide sufficient data
for comparison with countries of equivalent economic status.

There are no identifiers in any data sets with any specificity beyond countries 
and/or industry types.  There are no individual personal or corporate identifiers
in any of the data used.

#### Ethical implications of business requirements

Countries around the world have an interest in improving their economies, and 
corporations and businesses have a vested interest in riding on the back of economic
growth.  

This can lead to larger socio-economic questions (e.g. capitalism v socialism), 
but without measurement and monitoring such as that done by the ONS and OECD
there would be no record of economic performance, and managing at a macroeconomic
level would be impossible.

# Analysis

#### Stages in the data analysis process

The first step in analysis was to try to understand the vast quantities of data.

Excalidraw was used as a virtual sandbox to note ideas, develop plans and
to try to identify commonality between data sets that could be used to create joins,
etc.

The subsequent analysis followed the following method;

* Determine the average UK productivity relative to other EU countries
* Determine if any difference in UK v EU is statistically significant
* Look for variables to explain any difference in UK v EU (e.g. education levels)
* Focus on the UK as a whole; what differences are evident from
  * regional breakdown (check for statistical significance)
  * industry breakdown 
  * employee age breakdown
  * regional commuting time breakdown
* Further investigation was done into the Agriculture, Mining, Water and 
Electricity industry with no immediately obvious predictors of performance
* Try to derive an explanatory model for UK productivity based on output per
hour worked (Â£) as a function of year, industry, region, average no. people in 
employment

The outcome of the analysis showed the following;

* The data under consideration in this case did not provide a basis upon which 
to build a sophisticated predictive model
* There is no statistically significant difference between the average 
productivity of the UK v the average productivity of more productive EU countries
* There is a statistically significant difference between the most and least 
productive regions within the UK, with Scotland v London right on the edge of 
statistical significance
* Real Estate provided the highest pounds output per hour worked within the UK, 
although the exact measurement definition for this is not clear
* London was the most productive region by this measure, Wales was least 
productive, although specific, actionable reasons for this were not found in the 
data
* The best-fit linear model described UK national productivity as a function of 
Industry Type, Region, and Year
* No model, regardless of sophistication,  would have been able to reliably 
predict a one-off event such as Covid

Overall, a specific answer to the business question of improving the overall 
productivity of the UK was not found from this data.  What the data *did* show 
was that although there is not a statistically significant difference between
the UK and the most productive EU countries, there *are* statistically 
significant differences *within* the UK.

The recommendation of this analysis would therefore be to focus on these regional
differences in an effort to bring the poorest performing regions up to a similar 
standard as the top performing regions.  The net effect would be an overall
national improvement.





#### Tools for data analysis

All data cleaning, statistical analysis and plots were done using R in RStudio, 
predominantly using the `tidyverse`, `modelr` and `ggplot` packages.

#### Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

The analysis performed with this data set can be considered Descriptive 
Analytics.  

It was not possible to match all of the ONS and OECD data sets successfully to
produce a sophisticated, predictive model and instead a linear model showed that
productivity in the UK from 1997 - 2016 could be described as a function of 
Industry Type, Region and Year.  This model itself was able to account for
approximately 89% of variance in both train and test data, although no model
would have been able to predict the effect of an event like the spread of 
Covid-19.
